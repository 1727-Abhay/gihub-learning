### Q1.What are the common reasons for DMS migration failures, and how would you troubleshoot them?
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps migrate databases to AWS with minimal downtime.

Reasons for Failure & Troubleshooting:

**Connectivity Issues:** Check security groups, VPC, and test with ping or telnet.

**Incorrect Endpoint Configuration:** Ensure correct database credentials and use "Test Connection."

**Insufficient IAM Permissions:** Verify IAM roles and attach required policies.

**Resource Limitations:** Monitor CloudWatch and scale databases or DMS instance if needed.

**Unsupported Data Types:** Check DMS documentation and use AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).

**DMS Task Configuration:** Review task settings and transformation rules.

**Replication Instance Size:** Monitor resources and scale replication instance.

**Data Validation Failures:** Review validation logs and ensure schema compatibility.

**Network Latency/Timeout:** Check network bandwidth and adjust DMS timeouts.

**Insufficient Disk Space:** Monitor disk space and increase replication instance storage if necessary.

============================================================================

3. Full Load vs. Ongoing Replication in DMS:
Full Load:

Definition: Migrates all data from source to target in one-time bulk.

When to Use: Ideal for initial migrations when no ongoing changes are needed during the transfer (or downtime is acceptable).

Ongoing Replication (CDC):

Definition: Continuously captures and replicates changes (inserts, updates, deletes) after the initial full load.
When to Use: Used when you need to keep source and target in sync during migration, minimizing downtime.

============================================================================

4.Difference Between AWS EC2 and AWS Lambda:
1. AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
Definition: EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud where you can run applications, configure operating systems, and manage infrastructure. You have complete control over the server.
Use Case: Ideal for running long-running, complex applications or workloads that require consistent compute resources, custom configurations, or full OS control.
Scaling: You manage scaling by adjusting instance sizes or using Auto Scaling.
Billing: Pay for the instance uptime (per hour or per second).

2. AWS Lambda:
Definition: Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads, database changes). You don't manage servers or infrastructure.
Use Case: Best for event-driven, short-duration tasks, such as API backends, file processing, or real-time data processing.
Scaling: Automatically scales based on the number of requests. You don't have to manage scaling.
Billing: Pay only for the actual compute time (per millisecond of execution).

When to Choose One Over the Other:
Choose EC2 when:
                  You need full control over the operating system or the environment.
                  Running long or stateful applications.
                  You require custom configurations, persistent storage, or need to use specialized software that needs to be installed on the server.

Choose Lambda when:

             You want a serverless solution with automatic scaling.
              Running short-duration, event-driven tasks (e.g., handling HTTP requests, processing S3 uploads).
              You want to minimize infrastructure management and pay only for execution time.
+======================================================================

5.Security Groups vs. Network ACLs in AWS:
Security Groups:

Stateful: Automatically allows return traffic for inbound rules.
Instance-level: Applied to EC2 instances, load balancers, and other resources.
Allow rules only: Specifies what traffic is allowed.
Multiple associations: Can be linked to multiple resources.

Network ACLs:

Stateless: Requires explicit inbound and outbound rules.
Subnet-level: Applied to entire subnets within a VPC.
Allow and deny rules: Can specify both allow and deny rules for traffic.
Broad control: Provides control over all resources within a subnet.

Key Differences:
Security Groups: Stateful, instance-specific, only allow rules.
Network ACLs: Stateless, subnet-wide, allow and deny rules.

============================================================================
